# Football Players National Teams Analysis Project
This is a football player analysis project that is made to show data of footballers born within the years 1970 - 2009, their home countries, birth Countries, Nations they represent and the story and data we can get from this. In this project I implemented data cleaning, data preparation, data processing, analysis and visualisation.
In this Project I used Excel, SQL, and Tableau to carry out data Cleaning, data processing, analysis and Visualisation to tell a story.

My Tableau Visualizations of the data can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chidubem.victor.nwokolo/vizzes

THE QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS WERE:
1.Per the dataset How many footballers were born in each decade ?

2.What Country Has Produced Most Footballers from the range of players Born in the 70's to 2000's ?

3.Which birth time period has the Most players born in the time, playing for a country different from birth country ?

4. for each time period, explain what may be a reason for birth country to be different from playing country ?

5. Which Country has the Most Foreign Born Players ?


PROCESS FOR ANALYSIS
1. Cleaned the data by removing unnecessary description tags, as well as cells not useful for the analysis
2. I did some research via google and chat GPT on some players history that were missing/blank in the excel file and thus got rid of blanks that can affect analysis
3. i segmented the excel files, so each decade is in its own file, as well theres a general file of all decades put together
4. i created Pivot Tables in each excel file to show my work and how i arrive at my conclusions
5. i created Visualizations on Tableau to show visual representation of my owk.



Answers to the Questions:
1. from the dataset gotten from Kaggle.com, which got the Football Players Dataset from WWW.TRANSFERMARKT.COM, there are a total of around 540 Registered footballers captured, that were Born in the 70's (1970 - 1979) playing in the first division/leagues around the world, There were a total of around 6800 Registered footballers that were born in the 80's (1980 - 1989), There are a Total of 16,508 registred Footballers that were born in the 90's (1990 - 1999), There are a total of 8,706 registered/cap footballers born in the 2000's (2000 - 2009) all of which are/were playing in the top flight of the their respective League. giving a total of 32,555 Captured footballers that have played top division football across the world with Birth years ranging from 1970 - 2009

2.The country that Produced most top flight playing footballers that were born in the 70's (1970 - 1979) was Italy with 53 Players Produced, France comes second with 46 Players.
 
The Country that has the Most Footballers, Playing in Top Flight (first division) Football Globally, that were born in 80's (1980 - 1989) is Spain, with a Total of 492 Registered Players, coming in Second is Brazil with 470, and Coming in third is France with 390 Footballers.

The Country that produced the most Footballers, Playing in Top flight (first division) Football Globally, that were born in the 90's (1990 - 1999) is Italy, has a total of 992, 90's born footballers, coming after is spain with 927 and then Brazil with 893, The African country that has produced the most Footballers born in the 90's is Nigeria with 198 players.

For Players Born between (2000 - 2009), France has the most Players with 535 players, Italy coming in second with 513, and Spain Coming in third with 512 Players, Though these numbers are subject to change, as many at this time, are within the football youth system (U-21, U-20, U-17 teams) and can play Youth football for their country of birth/citizenship, and later switch to their country of ancestry (as seen with players like Fisnik Asllani who was born in Germany, represented Kosovo at U-17 level, Germany at U-18 & U-20 Level, only to represent Kosovo at Senior International level) & Vice Versa. There are also players who are of a different nationality/ancestry born in a different country and represent that country of their birth (an example is in the case of Michael Kayode who is ancestrally from Nigeria, but was born and raised in Italy and has represented the Italian National Team at U-16 Level) but as said previously, due to the heavy Youth football Numbers, this data for this age group is subject to change as players grow and allegiances are confirmed or switched.


In total, Spain has Produced the most players out of the dataset of players born in the years 1970 - 2009, 1969 players being produced, the most from a year being 116, that number being number of players born in the year 1997.


3. 80's (1980 - 1989)


4. Amongst 80's (1980 - 1989) born players, the countries with the most foreign born players is Russia, Ukraine and Serbia, but these being that the players were born in former republics (USSR and Yugoslavia), thus players born in parts of USSR that don't identify in modern Russia are thus flagged as "foreign born", but outside of these the country with most foreign born players is actually Turkey, with 68 foreign born players in the team, 43 of which were born in Germany. 


Amongst Players Born in the 90's (1990 - 1999), Serbia tops the list with 202 foreign born players, second is Russia with 157, and Ukraine with 115, but the bulk of this can be chalked down to the breakdown of Yugoslavia (SFR)/Yugoslavia (FR), as well as break up of USSR respectively, as various nations were formed after the break up of these republics in the 90's, meaning a player born in SFR Yugoslavia could play for the 5 resultant nations of the break up, and a player born in Yugoslavia FR, could play for Either Serbia or Montenegro. this applies to Russia as well, as players born in USSR, after the break up of USSR could play for any of the resulting countries e.g Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan...etc


Amongst players born In the 2000's ,Morocco has the Most Foreign born players with 74 Players, the most number of players born in France (28 players) followed by the Netherlands (17), Belgium (13), Spain (10) then other countries follow. this shows that Morocco has the highest number of 2000's born players repatriating to the country.


5. The Country with most foreign players technically is USSR, followed by Serbia, but with removal of USSR and Yugoslav component countries, the country with the most foreign born players, in the sense they were born in/ come from completely different countries and regions is MOROCCO, and the prevalence is amongst 2000's born (2000 - 2009) players.
